# DOTW-Final-Project
In class we discussed the idea that websites and webpages are contradicting words. With that said, I want to take advantage of this final project opportunity to create three experiential and interactive places on the web as the chance to remind users that websites can in fact be places/spaces to explore and experience as opposed to just simple documents. With that idea in mind, users will explore through an interface comprised of three different 3d objects to click on. Each shape will take the user to one of three spaces: sea, land or outer space. Each space will be comprised of audio, video, and interactive css animations and/or javascript mouse position interactions.
For example, in the sea space, users mouse position will be recorded to create a bubble-like effect when the mouse moves; or stars will follow the mouse in the outer space section.
The idea is to create a collaborative space where not only does the user pay attention (as I hope they are initially drawn into the space by the use of audio and video) but, also feels like they are being paid attention to (being that they have a say in the space/ are controlling the space with the mouse position interactions I aim to create).
